I initiated an independent research project with Dr. Joel Reardon for my undergraduate thesis. 
This project focused on a detailed exploration of the Android permission 
system's design and implementation, driven by my desire to uncover the 
root causes of Android permission breaches and the prevalence of overprivileged apps. 
The transition from Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research to 
the field of security research brought forth both challenges and profound fulfillment. 
Building upon my prior research experience, I applied my transferable research skills to 
this endeavor. My work encompassed conducting a comprehensive literature review and refining 
state-of-the-art API permission mappings [2, 3]. Additionally, I developed a pipeline for 
acquiring Android application APKs from the Google Play Store, followed by their decompilation,
permission usage data extraction, and mapping to the corresponding API calls. 
This journey also led me to explore various frequent itemset mining algorithms to identify 
optimal patterns in permission usage, ultimately culminating in the selection of the 
FP-mining algorithm. Our research uncovered noteworthy permission usage patterns among 35,117 
Android applications sourced from the Google Play Store. We meticulously constructed an 
API-permission mapping, comprising 1,976 API calls and 323 permissions. During our analysis, 
suspicions arose regarding the potential maliciousness of certain patterns, prompting us to 
engage in a manual examination of our application corpus and the decompiled smali packages to 
substantiate our concerns. Notably, we uncovered instances where applications exploited the 
combination of SET EXACT ALARM and ACCESS FINE LOCATION to periodically transmit device location 
data to external servers. However, due to constraints in time and personal challenges, we were 
unable to undertake a more extensive investigation of these potentially malicious applications or 
prepare them for the peer-review process. This comprehensive experience marked my robust introduction
to the realm of security research, further honing my transferable research skills, and 
instilling a resolute determination to address flaws and pursue greater achievements in the 
quest to demand more from our reality.

reverse engineering them into smali package. I explored several frequent itemset mining algorithm

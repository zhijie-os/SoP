My journey to the Mobile Robotics Lab at McGill University is rooted in a series of unique experiences and a deep-seated passion for technology. What sets me apart is the blend of personal growth, a relentless pursuit of knowledge, and an unwavering commitment to making a lasting impact on our ever-evolving world.

From a young age, I was captivated by the transformative power of technology. The rapid evolution of the digital landscape, from flip-phones to cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin, has been a constant source of wonder. This fascination led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in computer science at the University of Calgary. As I delved into the world of computer science, I discovered that there was no challenge too daunting, no concept too complex for me to grasp. This realization ignited my passion for the field and set me on a path of continuous learning.

My undergraduate years were marked by a deep dive into the world of Linux and low-level programming. I explored kernel development, crafted Bash scripts to automate tasks, and even embarked on the journey of building my own Linux system from scratch. My advocacy for the open-source movement became a driving force, leading me to immerse myself in the intricacies of cryptocurrency, particularly the decentralized nature of blockchain technology. I spent countless hours studying Bitcoin and Ethereum, from their whitepapers to their core implementations. The joy I derived from building my own Ethereum mining rigs in my dorm room was unparalleled.

My academic journey was equally fulfilling. I relished courses that challenged me to write a compiler from scratch, revealing the intricate workings of code generation, parsing, and lexing. I was relentless in my pursuit of knowledge, seeking opportunities beyond the classroom. This drive led me to approach Dr. Robin Cockett for a research project and to explore the world of functional programming's transformative potential.

Additionally, my research journey included significant contributions to the field. As the first author of the "realityCanvas" project at the Programmable Reality Lab, I played a pivotal role in its development. This experience not only expanded my research skills but also deepened my understanding of mixed reality and tangible interactions. I was entrusted with leading and completing the project when other members gradually left. I worked tirelessly, coding interaction techniques, conducting user studies, and crafting the paper. The process of submitting our work to ACM CHI 2023 and engaging in the peer review process was enlightening and invigorating. While our work didn't make it to publication that cycle, the experience of defending my work and effort in an academic setting was truly awesome.

My commitment to research continued into my fourth year of university, where I collaborated with Dr. Joel Reardon on a full-year research project. This project delved into the Android permission system, an area distinct from my previous work. In the absence of a dedicated lab, I conducted independent research, syncing with Dr. Reardon regularly. I took on the ambitious task of updating outdated permission maps by cloning the Android repository and building a syntax analyzer to extract permissions from the source code. I meticulously analyzed over 10,000 applications, decompiling APKs into Smali code and identifying potential malicious combinations of APIs like setAlarm and getUserLocation.

These research experiences have shaped my dedication to exploring complex problems, my ability to work independently, and my unwavering passion for innovation. My dream of founding my own company, Gladiator Technologies, Inc., was born long before my undergraduate journey began. I am driven by the desire to contribute to the world through tangible creations, particularly in the realm of mixed reality. Robotics, with its ability to bridge the digital and physical worlds, is the perfect avenue to realize this vision.

By embarking on my master's journey at McGill University, I aim to further refine my skills and contribute to the Mobile Robotics Lab. My unique blend of coding proficiency, research background, innovative spirit, and a hunger for knowledge make me a strong candidate. I am equipped not only to excel in this field but also to leave a lasting mark on the academic community.

In conclusion, my journey has been shaped by a series of experiences and a relentless pursuit of knowledge. I possess the qualities of resilience, adaptability, and a commitment to making a difference. I am not just a student; I am a visionary eager to transform ideas into tangible reality, and I believe that the Mobile Robotics Lab at McGill University is the perfect place to take this next step in my academic and professional journey.
